/**
 * Defines the model of the MVC that is defined in this example. When using Dolphin Platform a view-controller-pair will
 * share one model that is automatially synchronized between the view on the client and teh controller on the server.
 * The model will automatically instanziated and managed by the platform and its lifecylce is bound to lifecylce of the view.
 *
 * This basic model only contains one value. When defining models with Dolphin Platform all attributes must be
 * defined as observable properties. To do so Dolphin Platform provides the {@link Property} interface. A property
 * can contain a primitive datatype like String or int. In addition a property can contain another Dolphin Platform
 * model. By doing so a hierarchy can be defined. In addition Dolphin Platform contains extensions for the Java
 * collections API like an observable list. This types can be used in model classes, too.
